"""(p3.py) The text t contains information about family members. 
Define a function f1(t) that extracts the names and ages of family members from the text and returns these data in the form of a dictionary, 
in alphabetical order. Define a function f2(d) that returns the total age of all family members based on the dictionary data. Example:
f1("Mark is 24 and Ann is 27")  {"Ann":27, "Mark":24}
f1("Peter is 11, Barbara is 7 and their grandfather John is 103!!")  {"Barbara":7, "John":103, "Peter":11} 
f2(f1("Mark is 24 and Ann is 27"))  51
f2(f1("Peter is 11, Barbara is 7 and their grandfather John is 103!!"))  121
